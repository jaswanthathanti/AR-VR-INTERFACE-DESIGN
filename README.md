*DESCRIPTION*: This is a cutting-edge AR/VR interface prototype designed for intuitive 3D content creation and manipulation. The application demonstrates advanced spatial computing principles with a focus on natural user interactions.

Key Features
üéØ Intuitive Interaction Methods:

Hand Gesture Recognition: Real-time hand tracking with visual feedback
Voice Commands: Natural language processing for voice-controlled actions
Eye Tracking: Gaze-based object selection and interaction
Spatial Navigation: 3D-aware interface elements with depth perception
üõ†Ô∏è Core Functionality:

3D Object Creation: Instant creation of primitives (cubes, spheres, cylinders, planes)
Real-time Manipulation: Position, rotation, and scale controls with live feedback
Material System: Dynamic color and texture assignment
Scene Management: Undo/redo, view reset, and wireframe toggle
üé® Visual Design Elements:

Holographic UI: Translucent panels with backdrop blur effects
Neon Aesthetics: Cyberpunk-inspired color palette with glowing accents
Floating Interface: Gravity-defying UI elements that respond to user proximity
Smooth Animations: Fluid transitions and hover effects throughout
üì± Accessibility Features:

Multi-modal Input: Support for traditional mouse/keyboard alongside VR inputs
Visual Feedback: Clear indication of active tools and selected objects
Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
Keyboard Shortcuts: Quick access to common functions
Technical Innovations
Gesture Simulation Engine: Advanced JavaScript system that simulates realistic hand movements and gesture recognition patterns.

Spatial Audio Integration: Ready for 3D positional audio implementation with distance-based volume control.

Performance Optimization: Efficient rendering pipeline with CSS transforms and hardware acceleration.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works across desktop browsers and is ready for WebXR implementation.

Pain Points Addressed
Complex Tool Selection: Simplified with large, easily accessible tool panels
Spatial Disorientation: Visual anchors and clear depth cues prevent user confusion
Gesture Fatigue: Intelligent gesture recognition reduces repetitive movements
Learning Curve: Intuitive iconography and progressive disclosure of features
Future Enhancements Ready
WebXR API integration for true VR headset support
Real-time collaboration features
Advanced physics simulation
AI-powered content generation
This prototype showcases the future of spatial computing interfaces, where users can naturally interact with digital content using gestures, voice, and gaze - making 3D design as intuitive as working with physical objects.
